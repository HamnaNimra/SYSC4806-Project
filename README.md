# SYSC4806-Project

## Milestone 1: 

Early prototype. Give a 10-15 minute demo during the lab on March 12th.

For this milestone we are looking to see enough functionality to get a feel for the system and how it will
work. One important use case should be operational. It should collect data from the back end, do
something with it and display the result. The display doesn't need to be fancy. There should be a GitHub
repo, integrated with Travis CI (or other hosted CI), and the app should be up and running on Heroku.
We will also inspect the README file, the Issues, the Kanban, the code reviews, the tests, and we will
verify that everybody is participating in all aspects of the project (if that is not the case, different team
members will end up with different grades).

## 3- Amazin online bookstore

Bookstore Owner can upload and edit Book information (ISBN, picture, description, author, publisher,...) and inventory. User can search for, and browse through, the books in the bookstore, sort/filter them based on the above information. User can then decide to purchase one or many books by putting them in the Shopping Cart and proceeding to Checkout. The purchase itself will obviously be simulated, but purchases cannot exceed the inventory. User can also view Book Recommendations based on past purchases. This is done by looking for users whose purchases are most similar (using Jaccard distance: Google it!), and then recommending books purchased by those similar users but that the current User hasn't yet purchased.
